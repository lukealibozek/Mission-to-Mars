The project consisted of the following objectives:

1. Scrape the latest Mars-related headline from `redplanetscience.com`
2. Scrape the latest full-resolution image of Mars from `spaceimages-mars.com`
3. Scrape a collection of Mars facts from `galaxyfacts-mars.com`
4. Scrape full-resolution images of the Mars hemispheres from `marshemispheres.com`
5. Organize a clean and responsive layout of all the aformentioned data
6. Create a flask app with live scraping capabilities to enable an on-demand scrape of the aforementioned data upon the click of a button
